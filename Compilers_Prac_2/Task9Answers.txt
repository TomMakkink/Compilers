Task 9: Luke des Tombe, Jefferey Skeen, Tom Makkink

Limit: 4000 and the number of iterations:1000

Emulator		|		Sieve2.Pvm			||			Sieve3.pvm

Asm1.exe		|		4.04s				||				0.30s


Asm2.exe 		|		2.22s				||     			0.20s


The results of the timings are as we expected, with Sieve3.pvm being faster than Sieve2.pvm, and Asm2.exe 
performing better than Asm1.exe. Sieve3 was faster due to the additional op codes that were utilised, 
which meant that fewer fetch cycles were used to execute the same functionality, which improved 
overall performance. Asm2.exe performed better than Asm1.exe because no auxiliary methods were called, as
memory was modified directly.
